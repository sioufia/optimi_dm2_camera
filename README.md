Readme of the DM2 of optimisation project.

Integer Programming method:

    Steps to run it:
        1/ Go to the folder optimi_dm2_camera via your terminal
        2/ Launch the integer_programming.py file with python: python integer_programming.py
    
    Explanations:
    The variables of the problem are X and Y. 
    X is a list of coordinates of all the grid (800 x 800) --> It can takes the values:
        - 1 if there is a camera of type 1 in this position
        - 0 if not
    Y is the same but for the cameras of type 2

    The constraint is to have for each artwork a camera which covers it.

    The objective is to minimize the cost of the camera.

    Results: cost of 2680
